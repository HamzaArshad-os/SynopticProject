test file, ignore me , github confirmation aswell as notes

the projct will currently be designed to work with just YAMLResolved , the reasoning for this as Resolved 
will contain the most amount of data. Refrencing other data wont be an issue, and is often considered a complete
overview of the Specification.

Will if get the chance implement avaialbility to give a JSON Resolved file instead of YAML





//Installation requirments
npm install js-yaml
npm install axios
npm install --save-dev mocha
npm install paths


Note that current json-schema-faker libary does not have support for Dates. OpenAPI handles Dates as Strings, Please consider this when editing the maximum string length paramter. 
Application will now ignore String Rules if it results in not allowing for dates to be generated.
User is now able to view all formats define din specification and mannnually change if rules are applied to them or not

current support for 
Path Parameters: These are defined in the parameters section of the path item object. They are part of the URL path (e.g., /articles/{article_id}). Being developedd
Query Parameters: These are also defined in the parameters section but are appended to the URL after a ? (e.g., /articles?sort=desc). No
Header Parameters: These are defined in the parameters section and are included in the request header. No
Cookie Parameters: These are defined in the parameters section and are included in the Cookie header. No


Formatting extension will add commas where they should not be sometime

Please note that this code assumes that your OpenAPI specification is 
correctly formatted and follows the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) version 3.0.0. 
If your specification uses a different version of OAS or has a different format, 
you may need to adjust the code accordingly. Also, this code does not handle all 
possible cases and features of OAS, such as parameters in other locations than the 
path or header, multiple content types, etc. You may need to extend this code to 
handle these cases and features if they are used in your specification.

Currently only generates json mockData format 


Handling Resolved and Unresolved YAML Formats: The project’s plan to support both resolved and unresolved YAML formats introduces some challenges. Here’s how it could impact your current code:

Schema and Parameter References:

In resolved YAML, schema and parameter references are replaced with their actual definitions. So, if your code relies on references (e.g., $ref), it will need to handle both resolved and unresolved formats.
When extracting schema and parameter data, you’ll need to account for whether the YAML is resolved or unresolved. Resolved YAML will have direct definitions, while unresolved YAML will have references.
Consider using conditional logic to check whether a reference exists and resolve it accordingly.
Validation and Consistency:

Resolved YAML ensures consistency because all references are resolved. However, unresolved YAML may have inconsistencies if references point to different definitions.
Your code should validate the consistency of schema and parameter definitions across resolved and unresolved formats. For example, ensure that a referenced schema matches its definition.
Handling Circular References:

Circular references (where schemas or parameters reference each other in a loop) can occur in unresolved YAML.
Detecting and handling circular references becomes crucial. You might need to limit recursion depth or handle such cases gracefully.
Performance Considerations:

Resolving references can be computationally expensive. If your project deals with large YAML files, performance might be impacted.
Optimize reference resolution to avoid unnecessary reprocessing.
Updating Paths:

When switching between resolved and unresolved formats, ensure that your code updates the paths (defaultSchemaPath and defaultParameterPath) accordingly.
Resolved YAML may have different paths due to direct definitions.
In summary, handling both resolved and unresolved YAML formats requires careful consideration of references, validation, circular dependencies, and performance. Plan your code architecture accordingly to accommodate these challenges.


try to incprroate 
defaultInvalidTypeProduct — If failOnInvalidTypes is disabled this value will be returned on any invalid type given (default: null)
defaultRandExpMax — Setup default value directly as RandExp.prototype.max (default: 10)
pruneProperties — Remove given properties from generated objects (default: [])
ignoreProperties — Skip given properties from being generated (default: [])
ignoreMissingRefs — If enabled, it will resolve to {} for unknown references (default: false)
failOnInvalidTypes — If enabled, it will throw an Error for unknown types (default: true)
failOnInvalidFormat — If enabled, it will throw an Error for unknown formats (default: true)
alwaysFakeOptionals — When enabled, it will set optionalsProbability: 1.0 and  fixedProbabilities: true (default: false)
optionalsProbability — A value from 0.0 to 1.0 to generate values in a consistent way, e.g. 0.5 will generate from 0% to 50% of values. Using arrays it means items, on objects they're properties, etc. (default: false)
fixedProbabilities — If enabled, then optionalsProbability: 0.5 will always generate the half of values (default: false)
useExamplesValue — If enabled, it will return a random value from examples or single value from example if present (default: false)
useDefaultValue — If enabled, it will return the default value if present (default: false)
requiredOnly — If enabled, only required properties will be generated (default: false)
minItems — Override minItems if it's less than this value (default: 0)
maxItems — Override maxItems if it's greater than this value (default: null)
minLength — Override minLength if it's less than this value (default: 0)
maxLength — Override maxLength if it's greater than this value (default: null)
refDepthMin — Set a minimum circular $ref depth to render (default: 0)
refDepthMax — Set a maximum circular $ref depth to render (default: 3)
resolveJsonPath — If enabled, it will expand jsonPath keywords on all generated objects (default: false)
reuseProperties — If enabled, it will try to generate missing properties from existing ones. Only when fillProperties is enabled too (default: false)
sortProperties — If true, properties will be sorted alphabetically, with false original order is kept, or null to keep them randomized (default: null)
fillProperties — If enabled, it will try to generate missing properties to fulfill the schema definition (default: true)
random — Setup a custom randonmess generator, useful for getting deterministic results (default: Math.random)
replaceEmptyByRandomValue — Replace default empty value by a random value (default: false)
omitNulls — Remove any generated null value from the resulting value (default: false)
minDateTime — When generating a string with format date-time, set the minimum date that will get selected. If it's a number it will be the offset from now in milliseconds (default: -2524608000000)
maxDateTime — When generating a string with format date-time, set the maximum date that will get selected. If it's a number it will be the offset from now in milliseconds (default: 1000)
