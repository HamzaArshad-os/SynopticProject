Plan

Instead of generating mockData for all by default as this can be considered inefficent
should access each endpoint and generate mockData as for each and then insert mockdata into test file.
Note that we can assume schemas will always be refrenced in the endpoint information but parameters may 
not always be refrenced but instead named in Resolved version of file. This considered will have a defualt 
path to the schemas and parameters, hardcoded but will be able to be changed in the futre. From ui layer 
functions such as changeSchemaPath, changeParameterPath. Generating data this way will allow for better
efficency

Rules, paramters and formats can be used and modified by the user , If have time will add a ui aspect to make it easier. 
Otherwise just a little how to section.
Rules and forms will be used to represent good and bad data depending on the response type expected
for the test. in paramters will have default eg iunteger of 4, will be stated to user the default value is 4 , hardcoded the above to variables that can be changed by the user.
