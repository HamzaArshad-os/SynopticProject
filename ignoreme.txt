test file, ignore me , github confirmation aswell as notes

the projct will currently be designed to work with just YAMLResolved , the reasoning for this as Resolved 
will contain the most amount of data. Refrencing other data wont be an issue, and is often considered a complete
overview of the Specification.

Will if get the chance implement avaialbility to give a JSON Resolved file instead of YAML
